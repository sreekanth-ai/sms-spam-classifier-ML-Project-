# Email Spam Classifier (Machine Learning + Streamlit App)
![Email Spam Detector](Email Spam Detection.png)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Developed a text classification system to detect spam emails and SMS using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. 
The system processes text, applies tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, then classifies messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam*. 
Deployed as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) with **NLTK**
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Classification using ML model (trained with Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit-based web UI for real-time predictions

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle (model persistence)
